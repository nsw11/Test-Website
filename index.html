            <div class="quote">"This is your dream. My kind splayed before you, powerless and afraid. All the X-Men have done is use their awesome power to protect a world that hates and fears them. 
                Behold, their reward. 
                What must we do to be good enough? 
                Is this the high road's destination? If so, I say, as I have too many times before, never again.
                ...today, I have saved you from your own, for an old friend has challenged me to remember this view of Earth. How vast it is versus how small we make it. 
                Charles Xavier entrusted me with his dream, and it does not ask you to love or embrace my kind as your own, but merely to accept that this is a shared world with a common future, and that my kind, like yours, have the right to live in it. I am trying to be better. Please. Do not make me let you down."</div>
